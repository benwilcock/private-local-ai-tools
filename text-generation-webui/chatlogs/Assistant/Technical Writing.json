            "The SQL `JOIN` command is used to combine records from two or more tables based on specified conditions. In relational databases, each table contains specific data related to its subject (e.g., vehicles and owners). When you want to display information from multiple tables together, you use the JOIN operation.\n\nHere's an example of a vehicles table:\n\n| VehicleID | Make    | Model   | Year  | Color |\n|-----------|---------|--------|-------|-------|\n| 1         | Toyota  | Camry   | 2015   | Blue  |\n| 2         | Honda   | Civic   | 2013   | Red   |\n| 3         | Ford    | Mustang | 2008   | Black |\n\nAnd an owners table:\n\n| OwnerID | Name       | Address          | Phone  |\n|---------|------------|------------------|--------|\n| 1       | Jane Doe   | 123 Main St.     | 555-123|\n| 2       | John Smith | 456 Elm St.      | 555-456|\n| 3       | Michael    | 789 Oak Lane    | 555-789|\n\nNow, to join these two tables based on the condition that each vehicle must have an owner and each owner must have a vehicle. We can use the SQL statement:\n\n```sql\nSELECT VehicleID, Make, Model, Year, Color, Name, Address, Phone\nFROM vehicles AS v\nJOIN owners AS o ON v.OwnerID = o.OwnerID;\n```\n\nThe result of this JOIN operation would be a combined table with data from both the vehicles and owners tables:\n\n| VehicleID | Make    | Model   | Year  | Color | Name       | Address          | Phone  |\n|-----------|---------|--------|-------|-------|------------|------------------|--------|\n| 1         | Toyota  | Camry   | 2015   | Blue  | Jane Doe   | 123 Main St.     | 555-123|\n| 2         | Honda   | Civic   | 2013   | Red   | John Smith | 456 Elm St.      | 555-456|\n| 3         | Ford    | Mustang | 2008   | Black | Michael    | 789 Oak Lane    | 555-789|\n\nThis combined table shows the data from both tables, allowing users to easily view information related to vehicles and their owners."
