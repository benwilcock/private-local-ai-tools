Use the pod's name to retrieve its log using the following command: `kubectl logs -n namespace <pod_name>`. Replace \"namespace\" with your actual namespace and \"pod_name\" with the pod's name from step 1.\n3. Inspect the logs for error messages or other useful information that may help you identify the issue causing the \"CrashLoopBackOff\" state.\n4. Address the issue identified in the log and recreate the pod using `kubectl delete pod <pod_name>` followed by `kubectl apply -f <file_path>`, where `<file_path>` is the path to your pod's YAML file containing its definition.\n5. Monitor the new pod as it starts up, and ensure that it no longer enters a \"CrashLoopBackOff\" state. If necessary, troubleshoot further using additional logs or debugging tools."
