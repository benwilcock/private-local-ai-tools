In the database, a vehicle can belong to only one owner but an owner can own many vehicles. Use the SQL language to create the database, its tables, and the relationships between them. Explain each step showing the SQL required.",
            "Sure! To create a database for storing vehicle information along with their owners using SQL, follow these steps:\n\n1. Create the database:\n```sql\nCREATE DATABASE vehicles;\n```\n\n2. Create the 'owners' table:\n```sql\nUSE vehicles;\nCREATE TABLE owners (\n    owner_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,\n    first_name VARCHAR(50),\n    last_name VARCHAR(50)\n);\n```\n\n3. Create the 'vehicles' table:\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE vehicles (\n    vehicle_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,\n    owner_id INT NOT NULL,\n    make VARCHAR(50),\n    model VARCHAR(50),\n    year INT,\n    FOREIGN KEY (owner_id) REFERENCES owners(owner_id)\n);\n```\n\n4. Add an index to the 'vehicles' table:\n```sql\nALTER TABLE vehicles ADD INDEX vehicle_owner_index(owner_id);\n```\n\n5. Create a view for easier querying of related data:\n```sql\nCREATE VIEW owned_vehicles AS\nSELECT o.first_name, o.last_name, v.make, v.model, v.year\nFROM vehicles v JOIN owners o ON (v.owner_id = o.owner_id);\n```\n\nNow your database is set up with the required tables and relationships between them for storing vehicle information along with their owners using SQL. You can further insert data into these tables and query the view `owned_vehicles` to get details of vehicles owned by specific owners."
